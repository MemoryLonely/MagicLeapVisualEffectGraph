# Magic Leap Visual Effect Graph

Few examples created to test Visual Effect Graph with Magic Leap. Keep in mind that some of the functionality in Lumin 0.22.0 doesn't work with Unity 2019.3.0b7, I will be updating this readme as soon as everything works in newer versions of Unity and Lumin.

Anyone interested in a walkthrough of this effects be sure to watch the following videos:
